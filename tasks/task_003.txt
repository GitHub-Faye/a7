# Task ID: 3
# Title: Design and Implement Database Models
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the database models for users, courses, exercises, and system monitoring as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Define the models for User, Role, Permission, Course, KnowledgePoint, Courseware, Exercise, StudentAnswer, LearningRecord, UsageStatistics, and PerformanceMetric. Implement relationships and constraints as per the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Test model creation, relationships, and constraints using Django's test framework. Ensure data integrity and validation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define User/Role/Permission models [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the data models for users, roles, and permissions, including their attributes and basic functionalities.
### Details:
Define fields like username, email for User; name, description for Role; and action, resource for Permission.
<info added on 2025-05-21T08:48:43.016Z>
Implemented User/Role/Permission models with the following updates: 1. Modified User model to include a foreign key relationship (role_obj) with Role model while retaining the legacy role string field for backward compatibility. 2. Integrated Django's built-in Permission model for role-based permission assignment, establishing a many-to-many relationship between Role and Permission. 3. Added automatic synchronization between role and role_obj fields in User.save() to ensure data consistency. 4. Enhanced User.has_perm() and has_module_perms() methods to support both direct permission checks and role-based checks. 5. Developed utility functions in permission_utils.py for role permission assignment, default role creation, and user role synchronization. 6. Implemented signal handlers in signals.py for user creation, role updates, and permission synchronization, with syncing_roles parameter to prevent recursive calls. 7. Created a management command sync_roles.py to resolve data inconsistencies by synchronizing user roles and permissions. 8. Enhanced admin.py with additional functionalities for user and role management, including synchronization and permission handling. 9. Conducted comprehensive testing covering role synchronization, role-permission relationships, permission cascading, management command functionality, and the impact of role updates on user permissions. All tests passed, confirming a robust role-based permission system with backward compatibility.
