Based on research, the following tasks will be implemented: 1. Enhance CustomTokenObtainPairView to ensure it returns complete user information. 2. Verify LogoutView functionality with token blacklisting. 3. Add TokenVerifyView for token validation, currently missing. 4. Include custom serializers for Swagger/ReDoc documentation to improve clarity. 5. Update URL routing configuration to ensure consistent naming and paths for all endpoints. These updates will ensure a more robust and reliable authentication system for the API.\n</info added on 2025-05-23T02:45:01.449Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-23T03:00:00.000Z>\nThe authentication endpoints have been successfully implemented and tested. Key updates include:\n1. **Token Verification Endpoint (TokenVerifyView)**: Added to a7/urls.py with path '/api/token/verify/' for validating access tokens.\n2. **Token Blacklist Endpoint (TokenBlacklistView)**: Added to a7/urls.py with path '/api/token/blacklist/' for securely blacklisting refresh tokens, accessible only to authenticated users.\n3. **API Documentation Enhancements**: Custom serializers (TokenObtainPairResponseSerializer, TokenRefreshResponseSerializer) added to users/serializers.py for clearer Swagger documentation.\n4. **Decorated View Classes**: Decorated JWT views (e.g., DecoratedTokenObtainPairView) in users/views.py with swagger_auto_schema for improved endpoint documentation.\n5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Added test methods (test_token_verify, test_token_blacklist, test_swagger_documentation, test_authenticated_token_operations) with all tests passing. These updates enhance security and usability for frontend applications.\n</info added on 2025-05-23T03:00:00.000Z>\n</info added on 2025-05-23T06:00:45.157Z>",
