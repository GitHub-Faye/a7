Established a separate Role model for granular permission control. 4. Implemented a full user management API (CRUD operations) with permission controls. 5. Custom permission classes (IsAdminOrReadOnly, IsUserOwnerOrStaff) were developed. 6. Configured the Django Admin interface for user management. 7. Custom serializers handle user creation and updates. 8. Integrated JWT Token authentication. The code structure includes models.py (User and Role models), serializers.py (user and role serializers), views.py (UserViewSet and RoleViewSet), permissions.py (custom permission classes), urls.py (API routing), admin.py (Admin configuration), signals.py (user creation signals), and apps.py (app configuration).
