# Task ID: 6
# Title: Integrate AI Services
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the AI service integration layer to interact with n8n's Webhook for AI services.
# Details:
Implement a service layer to handle requests to n8n's Webhook endpoints for AI services. Standardize request and response formats for the webhook interface. Implement caching and retry mechanisms for webhook calls.

# Test Strategy:
Test n8n Webhook integration with mock responses. Verify caching and retry mechanisms for webhook calls.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design n8n Webhook service layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the service layer specifically for n8n Webhook integration, including defining interfaces and methods.
### Details:
Focus on creating a robust service layer that can abstract n8n Webhook calls and handle basic error scenarios specific to n8n's API.

## 2. Standardize n8n Webhook formats [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Define and standardize request/response formats specifically for n8n Webhook integration.
### Details:
Ensure all data exchanged with n8n Webhooks follows a consistent format that matches n8n's expected schema and our application needs.

## 3. Implement caching for n8n Webhook responses [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Add caching mechanisms specifically for n8n Webhook responses to improve performance.
### Details:
Implement a caching strategy (e.g., in-memory or distributed cache) for frequently accessed n8n Webhook responses, considering n8n's rate limits and data freshness requirements.

## 4. Add retry logic for n8n Webhook calls [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Incorporate retry logic specifically for handling transient failures in n8n Webhook calls.
### Details:
Define retry policies (e.g., exponential backoff) that account for n8n's rate limits and integrate them into the service layer.

## 5. Test n8n Webhook integration with mocks [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Validate the service layer by testing with mock n8n Webhook services.
### Details:
Create mock n8n Webhook services to simulate various scenarios (e.g., failures, delays, rate limiting) and verify reliability of our integration.
