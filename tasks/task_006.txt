# Task ID: 6
# Title: Integrate AI Services
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the AI service integration layer to interact with n8n's Webhook for AI services.
# Details:
Implement a service layer to handle requests to n8n's Webhook endpoints for AI services. Standardize request and response formats for the webhook interface. Implement caching and retry mechanisms for webhook calls.

# Test Strategy:
Test n8n Webhook integration with mock responses. Verify caching and retry mechanisms for webhook calls.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design n8n Webhook service layer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the service layer specifically for n8n Webhook integration, including defining interfaces and methods.
### Details:
Focus on creating a robust service layer that can abstract n8n Webhook calls and handle basic error scenarios specific to n8n's API.

The n8n Webhook service layer has been successfully designed and implemented. Key accomplishments include: 1. Creation of a dedicated Django app `ai_services` for AI-related functionalities. 2. Design and implementation of `WebhookConfig` and `WebhookCallLog` models for storing Webhook configurations and call logs. 3. Development of a comprehensive exception handling layer with base class `N8nWebhookError` and subclasses `N8nConnectionError`, `N8nTimeoutError`, and `N8nResponseError`. 4. Implementation of `N8nWebhookClient` class with both synchronous and asynchronous methods for interacting with the n8n workflow platform. 5. Integration of `aiohttp` for asynchronous HTTP requests. 6. Resolution of synchronous database operations in asynchronous contexts using `sync_to_async`. 7. Creation of `N8nWebhookAPIView` for REST API endpoints. 8. URL routing configuration for API access via `/api/ai/webhook/`. 9. Addition of necessary configurations to `settings.py`. 10. Unit test coverage. 11. Comprehensive README documentation with usage instructions and examples. The design adheres to principles of separation of concerns, abstract interfaces, robust error handling, configurability, and logging.

Completed asynchronous testing development for the n8n Webhook service. Key updates include: 1. Comprehensive asynchronous test suite for view interfaces, with a focus on ragAI task type testing. 2. Full test configuration setup: pytest.ini configured for async testing (asyncio_mode=strict), conftest.py for global event loop and database access, and integration test markers and logging. 3. Implementation of 15 detailed async test cases: 9 for API views (TestN8nWebhookView) covering success requests, error handling, and authentication; 6 for client testing (TestN8nWebhookClient) covering success requests, error responses, and exception handling. 4. Resolution of key async testing challenges: sync_to_async for Django sync operations, monkeypatch for mocking async HTTP requests, and adjustments for server response structure validation. 5. Support for full test scenarios: successful API calls, error parameter handling (missing task_type, chatInput, sessionId), unauthenticated access (401), invalid or inactive webhooks (404), connection and timeout errors (500), and optional real n8n workflow integration testing (using integration marker). These tests ensure the n8n Webhook service behaves correctly under various conditions, with a focus on async operation effectiveness and security.

根据审查test_n8n_service.py文件，确认n8n Webhook服务层已完全实现并通过测试。该实现包含以下关键组件：
1. WebhookConfig和WebhookCallLog模型 - 用于存储webhook配置和调用日志
2. 完整的异常处理机制 - 包括N8nWebhookError基类及其子类N8nConnectionError、N8nTimeoutError和N8nResponseError
3. N8nWebhookClient类 - 提供同步和异步方法与n8n工作流平台交互
4. 异步HTTP请求支持 - 使用aiohttp库
5. 完善的API视图 - N8nWebhookAPIView用于REST API端点

测试覆盖了多种场景：
1. 成功请求场景
2. 参数错误处理（缺少task_type、chatInput、sessionId等）
3. 认证错误（401）
4. 无效或非活跃webhook处理（404）
5. 连接和超时错误（500）
6. 实际n8n工作流集成测试（使用integration标记）

已使用pytest.ini配置异步测试环境，设置了asyncio_mode=strict和适当的标记定义，确保测试有效性和可维护性。

任务6.1的所有要求已全部实现并验证完成。
