# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement User Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the user authentication and authorization system based on Django's built-in authentication.
# Details:
Extend Django's built-in User model to include role-based permissions. Implement login, logout, and password change functionalities. Ensure the system supports multiple roles (teacher, student, admin) with appropriate permissions.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, logout, and password change functionalities. Verify role-based access control.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Extend User model for roles [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the existing User model to include role fields and relationships.
### Details:

The User model has been successfully extended to include role fields and support a multi-role permission management system. Key implementations include: 1. Created a users app with a custom User model inheriting from AbstractUser. 2. Added role selection fields (admin/teacher/student) and a creation timestamp field. 3. Established a separate Role model for granular permission control. 4. Implemented a full user management API (CRUD operations) with permission controls. 5. Custom permission classes (IsAdminOrReadOnly, IsUserOwnerOrStaff) were developed. 6. Configured the Django Admin interface for user management. 7. Custom serializers handle user creation and updates. 8. Integrated JWT Token authentication. The code structure includes models.py (User and Role models), serializers.py (user and role serializers), views.py (UserViewSet and RoleViewSet), permissions.py (custom permission classes), urls.py (API routing), admin.py (Admin configuration), signals.py (user creation signals), and apps.py (app configuration). Database migrations are complete, and the system now supports user role management functionality.
