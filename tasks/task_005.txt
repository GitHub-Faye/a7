<info added on 2025-05-23T07:29:04.867Z>
Develop RESTful endpoints for Course operations with proper request/response handling. The implementation includes: 1) Three serializers (CourseSerializer, CourseCreateSerializer, CourseUpdateSerializer); 2) Permission controls (IsTeacherOrAdmin, IsCourseTeacherOrAdmin); 3) CourseViewSet for full CRUD functionality and additional my_courses action; 4) URL routing configuration and integration with the main application; 5) Comprehensive test cases validating functionality and permissions. Testing revealed and resolved issues with API response formatting and permission controls. All tests passed, including list retrieval (with pagination), detail retrieval, creation (with permissions), update (with permissions), deletion (with permissions), and teacher-specific course retrieval. The Course API is fully implemented and meets requirements.
