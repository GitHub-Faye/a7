# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Course Content Management API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop API endpoints for managing course content, including courses, knowledge points, and courseware.
# Details:
Create CRUD endpoints for Course, KnowledgePoint, and Courseware models. Implement validation and permissions for these endpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Test CRUD operations for course content. Verify permissions and validation rules.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Course CRUD API Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement CRUD endpoints for Course entity including create, read, update, and delete operations.
### Details:
Develop RESTful endpoints for Course operations with proper request/response handling.
<info added on 2025-05-23T07:29:04.867Z>
Develop RESTful endpoints for Course operations with proper request/response handling. The implementation includes: 1) Three serializers (CourseSerializer, CourseCreateSerializer, CourseUpdateSerializer); 2) Permission controls (IsTeacherOrAdmin, IsCourseTeacherOrAdmin); 3) CourseViewSet for full CRUD functionality and additional my_courses action; 4) URL routing configuration and integration with the main application; 5) Comprehensive test cases validating functionality and permissions. Testing revealed and resolved issues with API response formatting and permission controls. All tests passed, including list retrieval (with pagination), detail retrieval, creation (with permissions), update (with permissions), deletion (with permissions), and teacher-specific course retrieval. The Course API is fully implemented and meets requirements.

## 2. KnowledgePoint CRUD API Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement CRUD endpoints for KnowledgePoint entity including create, read, update, and delete operations.
### Details:
Develop RESTful endpoints for KnowledgePoint operations with proper request/response handling.
<info added on 2025-05-23T08:16:35.772Z>
The KnowledgePoint CRUD API has been successfully implemented and tested. Key components include:

1. **Serializers**:
   - KnowledgePointSerializer: Handles reading operations, including course title, parent knowledge point title, and child knowledge point list.
   - KnowledgePointCreateSerializer: Manages creation with validation to ensure parent and new knowledge points belong to the same course.
   - KnowledgePointUpdateSerializer: Handles updates with validation to prevent circular references and cross-course references.

2. **Permission Classes**:
   - IsKnowledgePointCourseTeacherOrAdmin: Ensures only teachers or admins of the course associated with the knowledge point can modify or delete it.

3. **ViewSets**:
   - KnowledgePointViewSet: Provides full CRUD operations with support for filtering by course and parent knowledge point, dynamic serializers, and permission control.
   - Custom actions: top_level (retrieves top-level knowledge points) and children (retrieves child knowledge points, sorted by importance in descending order).

4. **URL Routing**:
   - Registered knowledge-points route.

5. **Testing**:
   - Fixed assertions in test_children_knowledge_points to align with business logic.
   - All test cases pass, confirming the API's correct implementation.

All functional requirements are met, including:
- Hierarchical structure support (parent-child relationships).
- Filtering by course and parent knowledge point.
- Prevention of circular and cross-course references.
- Permission control based on course teachers.
- Full CRUD operations and custom endpoints.
