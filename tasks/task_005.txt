# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Course Content Management API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop API endpoints for managing course content, including courses, knowledge points, and courseware.
# Details:
Create CRUD endpoints for Course, KnowledgePoint, and Courseware models. Implement validation and permissions for these endpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Test CRUD operations for course content. Verify permissions and validation rules.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Course CRUD API Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement CRUD endpoints for Course entity including create, read, update, and delete operations.
### Details:
Develop RESTful endpoints for Course operations with proper request/response handling.
<info added on 2025-05-23T07:29:04.867Z>
Develop RESTful endpoints for Course operations with proper request/response handling. The implementation includes: 1) Three serializers (CourseSerializer, CourseCreateSerializer, CourseUpdateSerializer); 2) Permission controls (IsTeacherOrAdmin, IsCourseTeacherOrAdmin); 3) CourseViewSet for full CRUD functionality and additional my_courses action; 4) URL routing configuration and integration with the main application; 5) Comprehensive test cases validating functionality and permissions. Testing revealed and resolved issues with API response formatting and permission controls. All tests passed, including list retrieval (with pagination), detail retrieval, creation (with permissions), update (with permissions), deletion (with permissions), and teacher-specific course retrieval. The Course API is fully implemented and meets requirements.

## 2. KnowledgePoint CRUD API Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement CRUD endpoints for KnowledgePoint entity including create, read, update, and delete operations.
### Details:
Develop RESTful endpoints for KnowledgePoint operations with proper request/response handling.
<info added on 2025-05-23T08:16:35.772Z>
The KnowledgePoint CRUD API has been successfully implemented and tested. Key components include:

1. **Serializers**:
   - KnowledgePointSerializer: Handles reading operations, including course title, parent knowledge point title, and child knowledge point list.
   - KnowledgePointCreateSerializer: Manages creation with validation to ensure parent and new knowledge points belong to the same course.
   - KnowledgePointUpdateSerializer: Handles updates with validation to prevent circular references and cross-course references.

2. **Permission Classes**:
   - IsKnowledgePointCourseTeacherOrAdmin: Ensures only teachers or admins of the course associated with the knowledge point can modify or delete it.

3. **ViewSets**:
   - KnowledgePointViewSet: Provides full CRUD operations with support for filtering by course and parent knowledge point, dynamic serializers, and permission control.
   - Custom actions: top_level (retrieves top-level knowledge points) and children (retrieves child knowledge points, sorted by importance in descending order).

4. **URL Routing**:
   - Registered knowledge-points route.

5. **Testing**:
   - Fixed assertions in test_children_knowledge_points to align with business logic.
   - All test cases pass, confirming the API's correct implementation.

All functional requirements are met, including:
- Hierarchical structure support (parent-child relationships).
- Filtering by course and parent knowledge point.
- Prevention of circular and cross-course references.
- Permission control based on course teachers.
- Full CRUD operations and custom endpoints.

## 3. Courseware CRUD API Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement CRUD endpoints for Courseware entity including create, read, update, and delete operations.
### Details:
Develop RESTful endpoints for Courseware operations with proper request/response handling.
<info added on 2025-05-23T08:42:04.820Z>
The Courseware CRUD API has been successfully implemented and tested. Key components include:

1. **Serializers**:
   - `CoursewareSerializer`: Handles reading courseware details, including extended fields like course title, creator name, and type display name.
   - `CoursewareCreateSerializer`: Automatically sets the current user as the creator when creating new courseware.
   - `CoursewareUpdateSerializer`: Restricts updates to specific fields only.

2. **Permissions**:
   - `IsCoursewareCreatorOrAdmin`: Ensures only the courseware creator or an admin can modify or delete courseware.

3. **ViewSets**:
   - `CoursewareViewSet`: Provides full CRUD operations with support for filtering by course and type.
   - Includes a custom action `by_course` to retrieve all courseware for a specified course.

4. **Routing**:
   - Registered `CoursewareViewSet` with `DefaultRouter` to generate standard RESTful API paths.

5. **Testing**:
   - All 21 tests passed, including 8 specific test cases in `CoursewareAPITests`.
   - Verified permissions, filtering, and custom actions work as expected.

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/coursewares/`: List all courseware (supports filtering by course and type).
- `POST /api/coursewares/`: Create new courseware (requires teacher or admin permissions).
- `GET /api/coursewares/{id}/`: Retrieve specific courseware details.
- `PUT/PATCH /api/coursewares/{id}/`: Update specific courseware (requires creator or admin permissions).
- `DELETE /api/coursewares/{id}/`: Delete specific courseware (requires creator or admin permissions).
- `GET /api/coursewares/by_course/?course={id}`: Retrieve all courseware for a specified course.

## 4. Implement Validations [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Add validation logic to all CRUD endpoints to ensure data integrity and proper error handling.
### Details:
Implement input validation, business rule validation, and proper error responses for all endpoints.
<info added on 2025-05-23T09:31:38.637Z>
Validation logic has been fully implemented. Key updates include: 1. Created a ValidationUtils class for common validation tasks (text_field, existence, uniqueness). 2. Implemented a utility function validate_required_params for request parameter validation. 3. Added validation logic to all serializers, including field-level validation (validate_*), overall data validation (validate), object existence validation, uniqueness validation, and relationship integrity validation. 4. Updated custom actions in views to use validate_required_params for request parameter validation. 5. Added comprehensive tests covering various validation scenarios. 6. Leveraged the system's default exception handling mechanism without requiring custom exception handlers. The validation logic is now applied to all CRUD endpoints and custom actions, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

## 5. Test Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Create and execute test cases for all CRUD endpoints to verify functionality and validation.
### Details:
Develop unit tests and integration tests for Course, KnowledgePoint, and Courseware endpoints.
<info added on 2025-05-23T12:14:59.157Z>
Develop unit tests and integration tests for Course, KnowledgePoint, and Courseware endpoints. A comprehensive test file courses/tests_api_new.py has been created, covering: 1. Course API tests including role-based permissions (student, teacher, admin), CRUD operations, and special endpoints like my_courses. 2. KnowledgePoint API tests covering basic CRUD, filtering by course and parent, special endpoints like top_level and children, and cycle reference prevention. 3. Courseware API tests for basic CRUD, filtering by course and type, and special endpoints like by_course. The API consistently uses a nested data field in responses, which was accounted for in the test code. All 42 test cases passed, confirming the API's functional integrity and correctness.
