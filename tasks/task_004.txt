# Task ID: 4
# Title: Set Up API Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish the RESTful API framework using Django REST Framework.
# Details:
Configure Django REST Framework settings. Implement basic API endpoints for authentication and user management. Set up authentication middleware and error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test API endpoints for authentication and user management. Verify error handling and response formats.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure DRF settings [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Django REST Framework settings in the project configuration file.
### Details:
Update settings.py to include DRF configurations such as default authentication classes, pagination, and renderers.
<info added on 2025-05-22T15:39:26.157Z>
Updated settings.py with the following DRF configurations: 1. Authentication classes: JWT token and session authentication. 2. Permission classes: Default authentication required. 3. Pagination: PageNumberPagination with 20 items per page. 4. Renderers: JSONRenderer and BrowsableAPIRenderer. 5. Parsers: JSONParser, FormParser, and MultiPartParser. 6. Exception handling: Default exception handlers. 7. Filtering: SearchFilter and OrderingFilter. 8. Versioning: NamespaceVersioning. 9. JSON format: Enabled compressed JSON. 10. Time format: Configured datetime format. 11. Testing: Set test client to use JSON format by default. All configurations include detailed Chinese comments for clarity. Validated using Django's check command and confirmed functionality by running the development server.

## 2. Implement auth endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create authentication endpoints for user registration, login, and logout.
### Details:
Use DRF's built-in views or custom views to handle user authentication and token management.
<info added on 2025-05-23T02:45:01.449Z>
Use DRF's built-in views or custom views to handle user authentication and token management. Based on research, the following tasks will be implemented: 1. Enhance CustomTokenObtainPairView to ensure it returns complete user information. 2. Verify LogoutView functionality with token blacklisting. 3. Add TokenVerifyView for token validation, currently missing. 4. Include custom serializers for Swagger/ReDoc documentation to improve clarity. 5. Update URL routing configuration to ensure consistent naming and paths for all endpoints. These updates will ensure a more robust and reliable authentication system for the API.

The authentication endpoints have been successfully implemented and tested. Key updates include:
1. **Token Verification Endpoint (TokenVerifyView)**: Added to a7/urls.py with path '/api/token/verify/' for validating access tokens.
2. **Token Blacklist Endpoint (TokenBlacklistView)**: Added to a7/urls.py with path '/api/token/blacklist/' for securely blacklisting refresh tokens, accessible only to authenticated users.
3. **API Documentation Enhancements**: Custom serializers (TokenObtainPairResponseSerializer, TokenRefreshResponseSerializer) added to users/serializers.py for clearer Swagger documentation.
4. **Decorated View Classes**: Decorated JWT views (e.g., DecoratedTokenObtainPairView) in users/views.py with swagger_auto_schema for improved endpoint documentation.
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Added test methods (test_token_verify, test_token_blacklist, test_swagger_documentation, test_authenticated_token_operations) with all tests passing. These updates enhance security and usability for frontend applications.

## 3. Set up middleware [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Configure middleware to handle authentication and request processing.
### Details:
Add necessary middleware classes to settings.py to manage authentication tokens and request/response cycles.
<info added on 2025-05-23T06:49:37.461Z>
The middleware setup has been completed with the following implementations:

1. **JWT Authentication Middleware (users/middleware/jwt_auth_middleware.py)**: Validates JWT tokens, logs authentication processes, and handles invalid tokens.
2. **Request Logging Middleware (apps/core/middleware/request_logging_middleware.py)**: Logs API request details including method, path, status code, and response time.
3. **Request Processor Middleware (apps/core/middleware/request_processor_middleware.py)**: Processes request content, adds security headers, and enforces request size limits.

**Configuration in settings.py**:
- Added middleware to the MIDDLEWARE list.
- Commented out the unimplemented RoleBasedPermissionMiddleware.
- Configured middleware settings (log paths, exempt URLs, size limits, etc.).

**Testing**:
- Unit tests for all middleware functionalities (12 test cases) have passed.
- Integration tests via test_api.py confirm proper functionality for authentication, response headers, request size limits, and logging.

The server starts and runs as expected, with middleware providing secure authentication, request monitoring, and standardized response handling.
